# Installation
### Virtualenv (suggestion)
I suggest you install a virtual environment

```pip install virtualenv```

and then type:

```virtualenv env```

and enter into your virtual environment

```source env/bin/activate```

### Installing the dependencis
then install the dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

and finally install the furhat client

by going the directory of the furhat-client and typing (note that you have to be in your new virtual environment)

```python setup.py install```


# Running

```python main.py```

and now visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser
